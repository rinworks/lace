How to find folders for built-in and user-provided extensions: 
Location of built-in extensions: `Edit -> Preferences -> System` lists lots of preferences. The `User extensions` and `Inkscape extensions` (or perhaps `System extensions`)fields list the corresponding directories. On Windows, these appear to be:
- `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions`
- `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\inkscape\extensions`

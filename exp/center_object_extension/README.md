This extension was created entirely by Gemini CLI with the following prompt:
    write an inkex extension that places the center of the second selected object over the center of the  first selected
    object. The extension should be called CenterObject. Place any generated files in a folder under exp/         

The extension has not been tested. Just checking in the pure-AI-generated version.

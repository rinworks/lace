Sample SVGs

*testshape_ink.svg*

Simple shape generated within Inkscape

*testshape-ink-studio.svg*

testshape_ink imported into Shaper Studio and minimally modified to add cut information. Note the addition of the Shapertags and removal of the Inkscape tags. The paths are modified. Basically a new SVG.

*testshape-ink-studio-ink.svg*

testshape-ink-studio reimported into Inkscape and saved without change. Some inkscape view headings are added but otherwise it is unmodified. The shape object has become a path.

*[primitives]*
Folder of very simple shapes. Used for developing, debugging and testing
